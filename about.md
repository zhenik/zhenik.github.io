I do coding. As many of those who loves tech, I use my curiosity to gather knowledge. 
And `YES` - I love riddles and logic puzzles. I am happy to share my thoughts here.

I had an experience in topics like data streaming, clouds & integrations.
Lately, I work as a DevOps engineer in the Norwegian Tax Department. 

Buzzwords which describe my experience in general:
`[Java, Streaming, Kafka, Docker, Terraform, AWS, Angular, Backend dev, DevOps, Frontend dev]`

Buzzwords which best describe my work today: 
`[Vagrant, Ansible, Packer, Consul, Nomad, Vault, Docker, Terraform, Hive, Presto, MinIO, CD/CI]`
