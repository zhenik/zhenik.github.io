I do coding. As many of those who loves tech, I use my curiosity to gather knowledge. 
And `YES` - I love riddles and logic puzzles. I am happy to share my thoughts here.

I had an experience in topics like data streaming, clouds & integrations.
Lately, I work as a DevOps engineer in the Norwegian Tax Department. 

Some buzzwords which describe my work: terraform, nomad, consul, vault, docker, ansible, CD/CI.
